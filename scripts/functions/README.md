## functions
Independent utilities to be used wherever. 
Each file is a function or two, on it's own.
Modules here should be completely independent from any other utility,
except their dependencies (ff* utilities depend on `ffmpeg` for example.)
See `~/.shell-requirements`

*Do not source these files!*
