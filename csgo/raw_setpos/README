TODO: 
move this entire directory to utility_generator
convert .lineup file to JSON
add converter & creator to support lineup tags
make converter/creator all in one.
make it create profile per map (with arbitrary map name) AND tickrate

have two tabs: 
(first row)
1) create/append lineups in map
2) existing/saved map lineup cfg

(second row)
1)
pick CT or T side lineup
lineup position callout         -----
enter getpos thingy                 |
enter type as text                  |
save callout for future reference <--

2) see lineups per characteristic (A/A, CT/T, lineup position, date added/created, blob output (in UTF-8 text), delete button (WITH CONFIRMATION UPON CLICKING))

(third row, MAP INDEPENDENT, SHOULD OUTPUT ALL MAPS)
output options:
-) in autoexec.cfg (must give absolute path to autoexec)
    - must give key to bind to
    - add a specific characteristic/static recognizer for start/end line of machine generated, where the fuck we wrote everything... preferably in the end, before host_writecfg (or whatever it is, must check)
        - add a ; before starting to write anything... so we avoid having to deal with shitty autoexecs fucking us over...
        - if a start/end tag exists, delete everything... if start OR end tag is NOT there, or if there are duplicates, pop an error because the user fucked up

-) in lineups.cfg (output in current working directory, print path in the success/fail popup, and/or currently used file explorer)
    -) popup with specific instructions what to bind for what map
