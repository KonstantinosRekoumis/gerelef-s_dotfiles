# Firefox:
- `user.js` contains the recommended & default options for browsing with ff >= 50
- `userChrome.css` contains my personal changes for firefox, which includes removing the sidebar header, the toolbar tabs, & a strict size for the sidebar, as well as hiding it when the window size gets too small.
- `sidebery.rc` contains my default sidebery ff addon configuration
- `ublock.rc` contains my default ublock ff addon configuration
