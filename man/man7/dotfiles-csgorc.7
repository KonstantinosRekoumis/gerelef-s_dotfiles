.SH "NAME"
\fBdotfiles\-csgorc\fR \- configuration files for CS:GO
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
CS:GO (Counter\-Strike: Global Offensive) specific configuration files, located in another github submodule\. This is not something I use in each & every machine, so I thought it better not be inside the "root" \fBdotfile\fR directory\.
.SH "AUTHOR"
github \fIgithub\.com/gerelef/\fR
.SH "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS"
I try to keep up to the latest security practices, however I do not hold these practices religiously, nor should you\. Some configuration files take security more seriously than others, and some do not take it into consideration at all\.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
