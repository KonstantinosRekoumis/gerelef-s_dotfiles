dotfiles(7) -- configuration files for various applications
===========================================================

## SYNOPSIS
My personal dotfiles. I do not recommend to anyone seeking inspiration to blindly copy-paste my configs; they WILL introduce problems for you. The contents of each rc file, especially the .bashrc file, have been sourced by a variety of sources, including my personal experience & particularly my preferences.

There is no particular philosophy to these configuration files, it's all personal taste, and adhere to the latest versions of applications I use between my different personal computing platforms, which are, for the most part, running the same version.

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
I try to keep up to the latest security practices, however I do not hold these practices religiously, nor should you. Some configuration files take security more seriously than others, and some do not take it into consideration at all.
