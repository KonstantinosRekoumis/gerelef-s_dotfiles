.SH "NAME"
\fBdotfiles\-rc\fR \- configuration files for various applications
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
Generic configuration files from all kinds of sources\. The filenames should be a hint to their usage\. \fB\.bashrc\fR is heavily inspired & modified by this \.bashrc \fIhttps://gist\.github\.com/zachbrowne/8bc414c9f30192067831fafebd14255c\fR\. \fBrc/utils/\fR contains specific utilities that are somewhat independent; the dependencies of each script are clearly declared on the top, where they\'re sourced\. Any function that\'s exported should have a relevant manpage, although the code should be commented and/or is clear enough to stand on it\'s own\. If you think otherwise for a specific function, open an issue and we can talk about it\.
.SH "AUTHOR"
github \fIgithub\.com/gerelef/\fR
.SH "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS"
I try to keep up to the latest security practices, however I do not hold these practices religiously, nor should you\. Some configuration files take security more seriously than others, and some do not take it into consideration at all\.
