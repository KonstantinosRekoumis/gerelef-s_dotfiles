dotfiles-csgorc(7) -- configuration files for CS:GO
===========================================================

## SYNOPSIS
CS:GO (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) specific configuration files, located in another github submodule. This is not something I use in each & every machine, so I thought it better not be inside the "root" `dotfile` directory.

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
I try to keep up to the latest security practices, however I do not hold these practices religiously, nor should you. Some configuration files take security more seriously than others, and some do not take it into consideration at all.
